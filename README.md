___________________________________________________________
# Description
A simple encryption and decryption algorithm in ARM assembly. Given a text message (string) stored in the memory, the encryption program gets the ASCII code of each character and apply one of 
the following simple encryption criteria. The encrypted character is stored back in a different location in the memory.
